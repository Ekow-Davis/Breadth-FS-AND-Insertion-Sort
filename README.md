# Breadth-FS-AND-Insertion-Sort
Breadth First search and Insertion sort Java implementation code

## How to run
java <filename>

## Insertion sort
say the number of elements

List them on the next line each

Pick Order

Enter to run

## BFS
Says the available nodes and asks for start point

Asks for destination

Provides the Unique Node Paths to it

## Time & Space Complexity for BFS
Time Complexity
All Cases: O(V + E)
V is the number of vertices
E is the number of edges

Space Complexity: O(n)
n is the number of nodes

## Time & Space Complexity for Insertion sort
Time Complexity
Worst and Average Case: O(n^2)
Best Case: O(n)

Space Complexity
All Cases: O(n)

n is the number of nodes in the array
